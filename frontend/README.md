# React Web App (Vite + CoreUI + Bootstrap)

## 📖 Overview
This is a React-based web application built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast development and optimized production builds.  
It uses [CoreUI](https://coreui.io/), [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/), and modern React libraries for UI and routing.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `index.html` – Main entry point.  
- `src/` – Source code of the React app.  
- `package.json` – Dependencies and project scripts.  
- `vite.config.js` – Vite configuration.  
- `eslint.config.js` – ESLint configuration for code quality.  
- `node_modules/` – Installed dependencies (generated after installation).  

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher recommended)  
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
